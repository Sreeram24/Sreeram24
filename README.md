This project is focused on examining the security for the email servers. A website is built in which the user will be able to enter his/her domain name to check for authenticity. We will deploy email security technologies such as anti-spoofing for quick identification of spoofed IPs and to intensify the level of authorization of the IP address, that are coming from a specific email domain. We will use protocols like TLS, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, DANE, STARTTLS, MTA-STS and also the standards of email certificates to give out an overview report.
